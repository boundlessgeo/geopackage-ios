/**
 * Draws a tile indicating the number of features that exist within the tile, visible when zoomed
 * in closer. The number is drawn in the center of the tile and by default is surrounded by a colored
 * circle with border.  By default a tile border is drawn and the tile is colored (transparently
 * most likely). The paint objects for each draw type can be modified to or set to null (except for
 * the text paint object).
